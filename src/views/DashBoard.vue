        <h1>The Bet</h1>
        <p>By Anton Chekhov</p>
        <hr />
        <p>
            At a banker's dinner party fifteen years ago, a young lawyer defended the position that
            life in prison is far less humane than capital punishment. The banker disagreed and
            proposed they bet—two million rubles in exchange for fifteen years of solitary
            confinement. The terms of their agreement allowed the lawyer to have access to books,
            food, and wine, and over the course of his imprisonment, he read widely. Nearing the end
            of the fifteen years, the banker comes to realize that he will be ruined by the lawyer's
            winning of the bet, and both men find their lives changed by the lessons that the bet
            has taught them.

        <p>I. The Party</p>

        <p>
            In the luxurious house of a famous banker, a heated discussion raged during a dinner
            party. The topic at hand: the death penalty versus life imprisonment. A young lawyer,
            passionately arguing against capital punishment, claimed that a living hell behind bars
            was a fate far worse than death.

            The banker, a man accustomed to wielding power and controlling destinies, scoffed at the
            lawyer's notion. “Living death? Nonsense!” he boomed. “Fifteen years in solitary
            confinement, with books and music, with wine and the finest meals – what is that in
            comparison to the swift oblivion of the executioner’s axe?”
        </p>
        <p>
            Fueled by pride and a thirst for notoriety, the lawyer, captivated by the banker’s
            arrogant challenge, declared, “I accept your wager! Fifteen years in solitary
            confinement for two million rubles!”
        </p>
        <p>
            Thus, a pact was forged, signed with wine and witnessed by the astonished guests. Little
            did they know the profound journey of self-discovery and the agonizing test of will that
            awaited the young lawyer.
